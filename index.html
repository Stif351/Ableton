              Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning.

              We feel the same way about making Ableton products.

              We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our
               headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.

              Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and 
              Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. 
              Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. 
              What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to 
              contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

              people what they need to work their magic and grow. 
              We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams 
              that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider 
              set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion 
              and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

              Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge 
              and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
               development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques 
               and best practices.

              We’ll even provide you with free German or English lessons. Plus, working
               in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and 
               your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours 
               are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings
